&lt;li>You will need underwear, bodysuits or tight-fitting clothing to shoot silhouettes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you wish, you can take nude photos.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For a photo &lt;em>on a black background&lt;/em>, you need light underwear (nude, beige, white, pink, etc.). Black underwear and clothes are not suitable. You can wear light-colored jeans.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Underwear of any color is suitable for a photo &lt;em>on a white background&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>

Information for those who are going for a photoday
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Please note that the time for changing clothes, rearranging lights and props is included in these 30 minutes.
If you are late for shooting - the time of your photo session is reduced, you can extend the shooting only for an additional fee and only if the time after you is not busy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A photo day is a bustle, haste, unexpected delays and incidents. It happens that everyone is late: both clients and makeup artists. Sometimes the photographer gets carried away and forgets about time. The human factor operates exponentially. You can&amp;rsquo;t do without it, really.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Remember, &lt;mark>the main thing&lt;/mark> is not the time! But &lt;em>&lt;mark>the photos that you will get&lt;/mark>.&lt;/em> They will be incredibly beautiful IF YOU are in a good mood and relaxed, so please don&amp;rsquo;t screw yourself up.
7 good photos can be taken in 5 minutes if people are positive and actively participate in the shooting.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>In general, do not think about the time, think about the mood and enjoy what is happening.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>One of the advantages of the Vogue style is that we are not limited to the interior and can freely use outerwear in our set-ups.

&lt;li>lace peignoirs&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="important-details">Important details&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Prepare your shoes for shooting - the soles must be clean so as not to leave marks on paper backgrounds in the studio. The shoes in which you came to the shooting will not work, even if you just got out of the car to the studio in them. Or you will need to glue the sole with painting tape.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Manicure should be neutral - French or light pink, natural tones will do. A neutral pedicure is also desirable if we plan to take full-length photos with bare feet or in open shoes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Iron or steam all clothes.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="./pregnancy-photosession-in-Vogue-style-3.jpg" alt="pregnancy photosession in Vogue style in Tallinn">&lt;/p>
